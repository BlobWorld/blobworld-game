BlobWorld is a concept for a multiplayer online game that would be based on nations growing and attacking other nations. The player gets to pick a name on the simple title screen and gets a blob with a random RGB color so two players don’t get the same color very often, if both of them, for example, doesn’t choose a name, and they both end up looking exactly the same (a problem that occurred with agario).

If a player moves his mouse to a certain part of the screen on the continent, his country expands in that direction. If he hovers his mouse over another country, it only glues to the border and doesn’t attack it. If the player presses on the country, the country’s blob is “pressured” into being a part of the player’s country. As the player’s lands expands, his speed of expanding grows slower.

If a player right-clicks a part of his acquired land, a small dot of his color is put on it (is also visible here if you look closely). This dot will repel attacks from smaller nations, and put attacks on them instead. This mechanic is useful because after some time other countries will be able to take down the dots, aka. “cities” and the player cannot expand if his city is surrounded with dots, therefore making his already existing land more stable, but not winning anymore land (there could also be a system which disallows placing the dots too close together).
